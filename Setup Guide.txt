STARTUP GUIDE (for SURF-COM receiver)
* text in << >> is meant to be replaced by you


Before running the receiver code on your Raspberry Pi Zero, set up Pi for microphone input. In terminal:

sudo apt install
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3-pyudev
sudo apt upgrade python3-pyudev
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
aplay --list-devices

sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
(Disable the RaspberyPi onboard sound card, by commenting out the line: dtparam=audio=on in /boot/config.txt)
	Ctrl S Ctrl X

sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
(Make the USB Audio card the default device in alsa by updating defaults.ctl.card and defaults.pcm.card to 1 in /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf)
	defaults.ctl.card 1
	defaults.pcm.card 1
	Ctrl S Ctrl X
aplay --list-devices

sudo apt-get install jackd2
sudo apt-get update
jackd -d alsa
reboot


Next, create virtual environment and install libraries:
1) create a virtual environment: 					  python -m venv <</path/to/new/virtual/environment>>
2) startup in virtual environment with the following command:             source <<name>>/bin/activate
3) install libraries (see Library guide)


If driving actuators directly from Pi:
1) initialize PiGPIO Pin Factory with the following command:              sudo pigpiod
 (resets on system reboot)
or
2) set PiGPIO as the default pin factory:			          sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
 (permanent until manually undone)


If running in headless mode (booting directly into running this code):
1) open rc.local to write the commands you want to run on startup:	  sudo nano /etc/rc.local
2) write the command to run the script, including the full path to 
   both the Python interpreter (virtual environment if applicable)
   and the script; optionally ask it to create a file with any
   console outputs (a log) that you can use to debug;
   always put commands before line "exit 0"      			  sudo home/<<venv_location>>/bin/python3 /home/<<code_location>>/<<receiver.py>> >/home/dragon/Desktop/boot-log.txt 2>&1 &
3) Press Ctrl + X, then Y, and Enter to save and exit the editor.
4) reboot
